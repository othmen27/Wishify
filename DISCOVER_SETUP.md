# Discover Feature Setup Guide

## What I Fixed

### ✅ Backend (Already Good!)
- `/api/wishes/public` endpoint exists and works correctly
- Properly populates user data with `username`
- Returns wishes sorted by creation date

### ✅ Frontend (Fixed Issues)
1. **Fixed API Call**: Updated `getPublicWishes()` function to call the correct endpoint
2. **Added State Management**: DiscoverFeed now uses React state to manage wishes
3. **Updated WishlistCard**: Now displays actual database wish structure
4. **Added Proxy**: Client now forwards API calls to backend server
5. **Added Loading/Error States**: Better user experience

## How to Test

### 1. Start Both Servers
```bash
# Terminal 1 - Backend
cd server
npm start

# Terminal 2 - Frontend  
cd client
npm start
```

### 2. Create Some Test Wishes
1. Sign up/login to your app
2. Create some wishes with `visibility: 'public'`
3. Make sure to include:
   - Title
   - Description
   - Category (gaming, tech, etc.)
   - Priority (low, medium, high)
   - Link (optional)
   - Image URL (optional)

### 3. Test Discover Page
1. Navigate to the Discover page
2. You should see your public wishes displayed as cards
3. Each card should show:
   - Username
   - Creation date
   - Title
   - Description
   - Category and priority tags
   - Action buttons

## Expected Data Structure

Each wish from the database has:
```javascript
{
  _id: "wish_id",
  title: "Wish title",
  description: "Wish description", 
  category: "tech|gaming|fashion|books|travel|home|sports|beauty|food|other",
  priority: "low|medium|high",
  visibility: "public|private",
  link: "optional_url",
  imageUrl: "optional_image_url",
  user: {
    _id: "user_id",
    username: "username"
  },
  createdAt: "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z",
  updatedAt: "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z"
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### If no wishes appear:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify backend is running on port 5000
3. Check if you have any public wishes in the database
4. Verify the proxy is working (check Network tab in dev tools)

### If you see errors:
1. Make sure MongoDB is connected
2. Check that the User model has a `username` field
3. Verify all required fields are present when creating wishes
